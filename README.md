# Prince Walkthrough

Prince Walkthrough is my first 2D game developed using the Godot Engine. This project was created while learning the fundamentals of game development by following a tutorial from the Brackeys YouTube channel. The game assets were provided by analogStudios_.

Although small in scope, this project helped me understand core concepts of 2D game development, scene structure, scripting, animations, physics, and UI systems in Godot.

## Game Overview

Prince Walkthrough is a 2D platformer where the player controls a prince who can move left and right, jump across platforms, collect coins, and avoid enemies.

### Objective

- Navigate through the level  
- Collect as many coins as possible  
- Avoid touching enemies  
- Reach the final wall  

When the player reaches the final wall, a "The End" message is displayed along with the total number of coins collected.
